# CME speed Prediction via Timeserie Analysis  

In this study, we explore CME speed prediction using (1) GOES soft **X-ray flux timeseries** data and (2) **flare features** extracted from X-ray times series data.
The task is under supervised machine leaning, and we use CME speed as a label. For binary classification, CME speed is binarized with threshold value of **500**.  The datset is derived from GOES flare catalog and GOES soft X-ray flux data. Example of dataset is as follow:
